Once upon a time there was a guy named Joseph, he was a barnacle farmer who
lived with his great aunt in Seattle.

Joseph farmed barnacles for a long time. So long, that barnacles began growing 
on Joseph! He didn't know what to do, so he talked to his Aunt and she said
he needed to see the doctor.

The doctor saw this strange phenomenon for the first time, he have no idea about
how to remove these barnacles from him. Three days later, Joseph was totally 
covered with the crazy growing barnacles, looks like he was wearing an armour.

The doctor first tried power washing the barnacles off and it worked!  But only
for a moment.  They came back within a day and the doctor decided to start thinking
outside the box...
