Once upon a time there was a guy named Joseph, he was a barnacle farmer who
lived with his great aunt in Seattle.

Joseph farmed barnacles for a long time. So long, that barnacles began growing 
on Joseph! He didn't know what to do, so he talked to his Aunt and she said
he needed to see the doctor.
